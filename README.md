# hello-world
This is my first repository on github, I will fill it with my time series graph problems.
Currently I am a Ph.D student at UC Davis, and I have to do a lot of stats, but mostly, before the past two years, have used software packages. Now, I am finally, kind of learning how to code for my statistics. Woohoo!
